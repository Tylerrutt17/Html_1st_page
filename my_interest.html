                <h3>Swift Programming Language</h3>
                <p>Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products.</p>

                <h4>Some Uses/Facts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apple has created this programming language to be used for pretty much anything - mobile apps (iOS Apps), server side and desk top application development. </li>
                    <li>Swift directly gets converted in to machine level code when compiled. So there is no byte code concept similar to Java.</li>
                    <li>It was developed with the main intention of replacing Objective C - which has been de facto programming language on Apple platforms for decades.</li>
